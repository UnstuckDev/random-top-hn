Back in the old days I loved to work on Thinkpads and loved their robustness. I&#x27;m owning a X1 Carbon and have to say that the quality is rather disappointing to me, display broke already presumably from lots of traveling. Macbook is okay, but for running and developing on Linux not very optimal. The keyboard on a Thinkpad is also nicer to use (imho). I moan that we don&#x27;t have the old days where Thinkpads used to be what they stand for, that is, being robust laptops for everyday development. Any experience &#x2F; recommendation with rugged laptops (e.g. the rugged Latitude)? If you were to buy a new (<i>robust</i>) laptop to work with and travel often, what would it be?","time":1537346727,"title":"Ask HN: Best robust laptop for everyday software development","type":"story"}
