One example would be design patterns - I found most of the design pattern explanations on the web pretty horrendous, and not as much care goes into them as the Haskell equivalents (e.g. monad tutorials!). So there is a &#x27;gap in the market&#x27; there I could hopefully explain them better.<p>I wanted to see if anyone has had any success blogging where success could mean:<p>1. Found out about a great job because someone reached out due to blogging.\n2. Got some freelance work in a similar fashion.\n3. Got promoted at work because of been seen as an expert.\n4. Framed themselves as an expert and got a better job or higher paid or genuinely &#x27;head hunted&#x27; as a result.<p>I&#x27;m interested in all experiences .NET or otherwise!","time":1537929128,"title":"Ask HN: Has blogging helped your career?","type":"story"}
