A couple days ago I installed Instagram from the App Store and created an IG account using an email like this &lt;lots_of_gibberish&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;.com (I have a catch-all setup for this domain). I didn&#x27;t give IG access to my contacts, didn&#x27;t provide my phone number nor connected it to Facebook.<p>At first the suggestions for new contacts in IG were completely random. However, after about 20-30 seconds the list of suggestions updated and showed me IG accounts of friends on Facebook.<p>I repeated this experiment, deleted &#x2F; installed the app, checked the iOS privacy controls, made sure not to enter the phone number or allow access to contacts, and again, I got the same account suggestions from FB friends.<p>I don&#x27;t undestand how Facebook &#x2F; Instagram is able to pull this off. The Instagram account email hasn&#x27;t been used at all before, the app doesn&#x27;t have access to my contacts and doesn&#x27;t know my phone number. AFAIK iOS apps are sandboxed and can&#x27;t fingerprint the device nor access each others cookies? So that leaves matching by IP and &#x2F; or location, however in a large building that would be quite inaccurate?<p>So how does Facebook do this?","time":1538073900,"title":"Ask HN: How does Instagram know who I am on Facebook?","type":"story"}
