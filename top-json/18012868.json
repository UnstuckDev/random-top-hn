I always use CSS &quot;framework&quot; on the frontend like Bootstrap and usually buy some theme when I start a project and start from there. I was always able to get the look that I wanted when I changed stuff in CSS but it was always with many trials and errors, usually trying stuff in the browsers inspect window until I get things right. I am sick of that so I would finally really like to properly learn CSS.<p>The end result that I like to achieve is that I would be able to not use CSS framework (maybe just something like tailwind css) and easily create and maintain responsive page designs. I am primarily interested in pure CSS stuff, not how to organize it, that is a broader topic especially if you use SPA framework, pre&#x2F;post processors, modules, etc.","time":1537251048,"title":"Ask HN: Best book or resource to REALLY grasp CSS?","type":"story"}
