I have two 4.0 GPAs, and have been trying to get research opportunities in ML&#x2F;RL&#x2F;Theoretical Neuroscience because I’m absolutely fascinated.  Unfortunately, I have a non traditional background with no research experience, and most professor’s don’t really give me an opportunity or even respond. I have a lot of product and entrepreneurship experience, and I really got deeper into theory in recent years. Are there ways I can get into research with this background? I’d like to eventually be able to get a PhD or do a residency.<p>I really appreciate the advice.","time":1537325166,"title":"Ask HN: How to break into CS research?","type":"story"}
