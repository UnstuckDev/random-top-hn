They&#x27;re forced to endure all the anger and fighting of social media, just to keep up to date.<p>The more people know about feeds, the more they use feeds, the more sites support feeds, and then more people learn about feeds in a virtuous cycle.<p>I hope to create more uptake of feeds amongst the general population, a more decentralised internet, and maybe just make the average user&#x27;s day a bit nicer.<p>Let me know what you think.  Questions, comments, all appreciated.  Spreading the word is <i>very</i> appreciated. :)","time":1537973763,"title":"Show HN: You Need Feeds â€“ Introduce friends/family/workmates to RSS and webfeeds","type":"story"}
