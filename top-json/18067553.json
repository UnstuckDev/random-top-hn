Today it was a page called &quot;Rock Music Community.&quot;<p>I tapped the name and was taken to the page itself, where it showed that I had liked and followed it. This is odd considering the two facts below, which I know to be true:<p>1) I use a secure password and keep track of active Facebook sessions. I am certain no one else is using my account in a malicious way.<p>2) I know for a fact that I never went to a page named &quot;Rock Music Community&quot; and pressed the like button.<p>That said, what is the deal? It has happened 4-5 times in the past as well, with different pages. Has anyone else experienced this?","time":1537891450,"title":"Ask HN: Does Facebook automatically “like” pages on your behalf?","type":"story"}
